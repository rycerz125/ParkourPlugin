# ParkourPlugin

The goal of this project is to create a module based, bukkit parkour plugin, so customizable that even non-programmer would be able to use it and configure it to his own needs.

# This is only core

To actually use it in some reasonable way the addon plugins are needed. Thanks to easy to use, bukkit like API and some standard plugins that would be developed by me, this should be no problem after first release.
